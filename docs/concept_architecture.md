# Milestone 3

## Project Context

There is a need for a unified portal for port management data analytics that includes data provenance.  
The current system, such as the one used by the Port of Sines, lacks metadata clarity and provenance tracking. This makes it difficult to analyze the origin, quality, and transformation history of data.

---

## Motivation

The platform aims to:
- Enable data visualization and analysis
- Provide full transparency of data origin and transformations
- Handle missing or incorrect data through automated correction and ML techniques

---

## State of the Art

Topics considered:
- Data Storage  
- Data Analytics  
- Maritime Data  
- Data Provenance  
- ML-based data completeness
