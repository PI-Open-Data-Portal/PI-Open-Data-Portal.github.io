# Provenance and W3C Tables

# Provenance in Information Systems

Provenance refers to the documentation of the origins, context, and transformation history of data. In information systems, provenance plays a crucial role in ensuring data quality, traceability, and accountability. By recording where data comes from, how it was processed, and by whom, provenance allows users to assess the reliability of information and supports reproducibility and compliance efforts.

Recent years have seen increasing emphasis on provenance in open data, scientific workflows, and critical infrastructure domains such as healthcare, energy, and maritime logistics. Provenance models range from high-level descriptions of data pipelines to fine-grained lineage at the level of individual tuples or values. In this section, we review two prominent approaches to provenance: the W3C PROV standard (Section 8.1.1) and tuple-level data provenance techniques (Section 8.1.2).

## W3C PROV

The W3C PROV standard defines a conceptual model for representing provenance on the Web and in distributed systems. It introduces three main types of elements:  
- **Entities** (data or artifacts)  
- **Activities** (processes or events)  
- **Agents** (actors responsible for processes)  

These elements are connected by relations such as `wasGeneratedBy`, `used`, and `wasAssociatedWith` to form directed provenance graphs.

W3C PROV has been widely adopted in domains where workflow documentation and process transparency are essential. For example, it is used in scientific workflow systems, research data repositories, and data catalogs to trace how datasets were derived or published. Its extensibility and serialization formats (PROV-XML, PROV-JSON, PROV-N) make it suitable for integration into databases, APIs, and visualization tools.

In the context of port management and logistics, applying W3C PROV can help track the lifecycle of maritime datasets as they are collected, transformed, validated, and published, thus improving data governance and trust among stakeholders.

## 8.1.2 Tuple-Level Data Provenance

While W3C PROV captures high-level workflows, tuple-level provenance focuses on tracing individual output records back to the specific input records and operations that produced them. This kind of fine-grained provenance is particularly useful in databases and data integration systems, where understanding how a query result was derived can help with debugging, auditing, and data quality assurance.

There are three core concepts commonly discussed in tuple-level provenance:  
- **Why-Provenance**: identifies which input tuples are responsible for a given output tuple.  
- **Where-Provenance**: indicates the source location or file of a data value.  
- **How-Provenance**: captures the sequence of operations and transformations that produced the result.

Several systems have been proposed to support data provenance in relational databases, such as Perm, Trio, and GProM. These systems can track provenance automatically at query runtime and generate explanations for output data. Recent research also explores visualization techniques to render provenance graphs interactively.

In maritime data platforms, such mechanisms allow organizations to trace suspicious or inconsistent records to their original sources. This capability is particularly important in environments that integrate data from multiple external stakeholders, such as port authorities, logistics companies, and shipping agents. Tuple-level provenance ensures that each data item can be justified by a clear lineage, enabling error tracking, regulatory compliance, and greater trust in analytics outcomes. By combining this approach with workflow provenance models like W3C PROV, it becomes possible to achieve full transparency from raw data ingestion to final published insights.
