## Frontend Overview

The frontend enables users to:
- Log in and navigate the portal
- Filter datasets and analytics
- Access metadata and provenance
- Upload or download data
- View data origin visually
- Report inconsistencies

## Backend Overview

Supports:
- Query processing
- Provenance logic
- Analytics services
- Example SQL queries (e.g., container plate tracking)

## Backend Provenance Example

An SQL-based example was used to demonstrate provenance traceability of containers using a composed query with hierarchical data entities.
