# Problems and Motivation

The current system used by the Port of Sines lacks clear metadata and **data provenance** tracking, making it challenging for users to determine the origin, transformation history, and reliability of the data. Additionally, the presence of **missing or incorrect data** further complicates data analysis and interpretation.

Our goal is to develop a platform that not only enables users to **visualize and analyze** detailed information but also provides full transparency regarding the origins and processing of the data. At the same time, the platform will address and correct issues related to missing and inaccurate data present in the original system.

## ‚ùó Identified Problems

- Lack of clear metadata.  
- No tracking of data provenance.  
- Difficulty for users in identifying:
  - The origin of the data;  
  - The transformation history;  
  - The reliability of the information.  
- The presence of missing or inaccurate data that complicates:
  - Data analysis;  
  - Proper interpretation of the information.

## üí° Proposed Solutions

Create a platform that:

- Detects missing data entries and completes them using ML models.  
- Implements **Data Provenance annotations** for the dataset:
  - Tracks and displays the origin of each dataset.  
  - Documents and presents the transformation history.  
  - Provides access to metadata associated with each dataset.  
- Allows users to access structured and detailed datasets.  
- Enables exporting of visualized data for external analysis.  
- Identifies and corrects inaccurate or inconsistent values.
