# Introduction

This project was carried out by a team of five students as part of the *Project in Informatics* course, within the Informatics Engineering degree at the University of Aveiro. It was proposed by the PSA and aimed to develop a maritime port management system integrating data provenance, automatic completion of missing data using MLM, and outlier detection with correction mechanisms, with some other features for quality of life.

We developed a system that initially processes operational data in our case study, limited to one semester of operations from PSA. Using MLM, the system fills in missing values for a specific, critical data field. Each data point is then annotated with a provenance token to trace its origin. Finally, we built an intuitive user interface that enables users to visualize, analyze, and better understand both the data and its history.
